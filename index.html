      <div class="content has-text-justified">
        <div style="text-align: justify;">
          <p>This overview is adapted from the original competition description.</p>
          <p><strong>1. Objective:</strong> The objective of the challenge is to develop a machine learning model
            capable of identifying and detecting "damaged" and "undamaged" coastal infrastructure, including residential
            and commercial buildings, affected by natural disasters such as hurricanes and cyclones.</p>
          <p>Participants will be provided with pre- and post-cyclone satellite images of an area impacted by Hurricane
            Maria in 2017. The task is to build a machine learning model capable of detecting four different types of
            objects in the satellite images of cyclone-affected areas:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Undamaged residential buildings</li>
            <li>Damaged residential buildings</li>
            <li>Undamaged commercial buildings</li>
            <li>Damaged commercial buildings</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>2. Dataset Used:</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Mandatory dataset:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>High-resolution panchromatic satellite images before and after a tropical cyclone: Maxar GeoEye-1
              (optical)</li>

      <h4 class="title is-3" style="white-space: nowrap;">Key Challenges</h4>
      <div class="content has-text-justified">
        <div style="text-align: justify;">
          <p>
            <strong>1. Dataset Collection:</strong> Manually annotating all four classes in the provided high-resolution
            satellite dataset from Maxar's GEO-1 mission, covering an area of 327 sq.km of San Juan, Puerto Rico, is a
            time-consuming task. With only one month for the competition duration, this task poses significant
            challenges in terms of time and energy allocation.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>2. Imbalanced Dataset:</strong> The dataset comprises four classes of building damages: undamaged
            commercial buildings, undamaged residential buildings, damaged commercial buildings, and damaged residential
            buildings. Our analysis reveals that damaged classes are underrepresented compared to undamaged ones.
            Additionally, residential buildings are more common than commercial buildings. This imbalance can introduce
            bias and affect the performance of our model, particularly towards the majority class.

  <!-- Key Challenges -->

  <!-- Proposed Approach -->
  <div class="columns is-centered has-text-centered">
    <div class="column is-four-fifths">
      <h4 class="title is-3" style="white-space: nowrap;">Proposed Approach</h4>
      <div class="content has-text-justified">
        <div style="text-align: justify;">
          <p>
            <strong>1. Parallel Annotation:</strong> Instead of annotating the entire dataset as a single unit, we adopt
            a strategy of segmenting the dataset into multiple tiles, each with a dimension of 512x512 pixels. We chose
            this specific dimension to closely match the size of the validation dataset, ensuring consistency between
            our training and evaluation processes. These tiles are distributed among team members to enable parallel
            annotation, thereby enhancing efficiency.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>2. Annotation of Mixed-Area Tiles Only:</strong> Our analysis of the validation dataset indicates
            that it covers regions with mixed land use, covering both commercial and residential areas. Therefore, we
            focus our annotation efforts solely on regions characterized by this mixed land use, optimizing resource
            utilization and annotation accuracy.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>3. Cross-Checking Building Classes for Accurate Labeling:</strong> Annotating building classes
            accurately poses a significant challenge, particularly without reliable reference points and solely rely on
            guessing. To address this, our approach incorporates the generation of Google Maps and OpenStreetMap tiles,
            aligned with the center coordinates of each dataset tile. Additionally, we utilize shapefiles provided by
            the organizers to identify building footprints. Furthermore, we extract center coordinates for each tile and
            leverage them to access 3D views of the corresponding areas on Google Maps. This effort of cross-referencing
            process ensures the accuracy of our manual annotations by validating them against multiple reliable sources.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>4. Synthetic Image Generation for Handling Imbalanced Datasets:</strong> To mitigate the class
            imbalance in our dataset, particularly in representing damaged building classes, we propose employing a
            synthetic image generation technique. We draw inspiration from recent research outlined in a paper detailing
            the application of Stable Diffusion 2 with LoRa adaptation for generating synthetic aerial images. By
            fine-tuning this model, we aim to create synthetic images of damaged building classes, thus narrowing the
            representation gap in our training dataset and reducing model bias. The paper we reference in our
            replication efforts can be found at the following link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12345
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>5. Transfer Learning through Fine-Tuning of a Pre-trained Model:</strong> To enhance the performance
            of our model, we employ transfer learning by fine-tuning our dataset with a pre-trained model. Specifically,
            we utilize the YOLOv8 model developed by Ultralytics as our pre-trained model. Leveraging transfer learning
            allows us to capitalize on the knowledge gained by the pre-trained model on a related task, facilitating
            faster convergence and potentially improving the accuracy of our predictions.

      <h4 class="title is-3" style="white-space: nowrap;">Methodology</h4>
      <div class="content has-text-justified">
        <div style="text-align: justify;">
          <p>
            <strong>1. Data Collection:</strong>
            The dataset consists of pre- and post-event satellite imagery partitioned into multiple tiles. Initially in
            GeoTiff format, each tile is converted to JPG to reduce storage consumption. With a total of 21,460 tiles,
            including both pre- and post-event images, we generated OpenStreetMap and GoogleMap representations for each
            tile by aligning and matching raster layers in QGIS. Additionally, building footprint information was
            extracted by aligning shapefile raster layers with the GeoTiff dataset.

            Manual filtering was performed to select only images with mixed areas of residential and commercial zones.
            Furthermore, we extracted center coordinates for each tile and leveraged them to access 3D views of the
            corresponding areas on Google Maps. This enabled us to label all the buildings with high confidence by
            cross-checking building classes from multiple references.

            All tiles were then distributed among team members for manual annotation using VGG Image Annotator and in
            COCO annotation format. Data hosting and version control were managed through GitHub, utilizing Git for
            seamless working between local and remote repositories.

            At the end of the competition, we manually annotated a total of 820 images. These annotations amounted to
            11,344 labels, distributed as follows: undamaged residential building (7951), undamaged commercial building
            (2249), damaged residential building (907), and damaged commercial building (237).

          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>2. Data Pipeline:</strong> To streamline workflow efficiency, we developed a data pipeline for data
            processing and training dataset preparation. This pipeline receives JSON files containing COCO annotation
            format data and undergoes multiple stages of processing, including JSON to COCO PyLabel dataset
            transformation, dataset aggregation from multiple inputs, and dataset cleaning. The pipeline ultimately
            produces YOLO structured files optimized for training YOLO-based models.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>3. Training Machine Learning Model:</strong> Effective training of the machine learning model
            requires substantial hardware resources and CUDA acceleration for accelerated training. We trained our model
            by leveraging Kaggle's cloud platform, which offers generous GPU access of 30 hours per week. Fine-tuning
            was performed on YOLOv8 pre-trained models provided by Ultralytics, utilizing their high-level framework for
            efficient model training and evaluation without the need for extensive architectural considerations.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>4. Monitoring Machine Learning Training:</strong> WandB is used for experiment monitoring,
            integrated with YOLOv8 training. This facilitated efficient experimentation with
            various YOLO variants and hyperparameters, enabling us to track and evaluate multiple models effectively.
            WandB served as a benchmarking tool, aiding in the selection of optimal model configurations and identifying
            areas for improvement.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>5. Synthetic Image Generation:</strong> To generate synthetic images, we chose to fine-tune the
            Stable Diffusion 2 model by StabilityAI. Training dataset preparation involved extracting images with
            bounding boxes for each class from our manually annotated dataset, used to fine-tune Stable Diffusion 2 for
            synthetic image generation. Experimentation with different settings and hyperparameters, including LoRa
            scale, training epochs was conducted, monitored using WandB. The dataset and trained Stable Diffusion models
            are hosted on Hugging Face.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>6. Evaluating the Trained Model:</strong> Trained models were evaluated based on metrics such as
            mAP50, precision, and recall for each class. Confusion matrices, confidence curves, precision-recall curves,
            and other metrics were utilized to assess model performance. Evaluation was conducted on WandB, enabling
            comprehensive analysis to ensure effective predictions for each class.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>7. Prediction of Trained Model:</strong> Evaluation of the trained model involved testing on 12
            validation images provided by the organizers. Results from the detection from each of the validation image
            (class, confidence score, bounding box coordinates) are saved in a .txt file and all the .txt files are
            saved in a single .zip file. This zip file is uploaded to the challenge platform to get a score on the
            ranking board. To enhance scores, prediction configurations were adjusted to minimize bounding box overlap
            and optimize confidence thresholds.

            The goal of Phase 1 is to identify and detect “damaged” and “undamaged” coastal infrastructure, which is an  
            object detection task. To tackle this challenge, our team has opted for Ultralytics <strong>YOLOv8</strong>, 
            one of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) object detection models renowned for its speed and accuracy. Despite the availability 
            of competitors like YOLOv9, we prefer Ultralytics YOLOv8 for its user-friendliness and well-documented workflows 
            that streamline training and deployment. We choose the smallest YOLOv8 - <strong>YOLOv8n</strong>, since it is 
            <strong>unwise to use larger model when dealing with limited dataset</strong>, as it may lead to overfitting. 
            Given more time, we would explore other YOLOv8 version and other SOTA models when we have a bigger dataset. 
          </p>

          <p>          
            Meanwhile, our empirical study revealed 
            that the main influencing factor on the detection accuracy is the quantity and quality of the annotated dataset. 
            Hence, we argue that the main focus of the challenge should be data annotation. We provide details on how we built 
            our training dataset in the next section.

            <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><strong>YOLOv8s:</strong> 0.30 - YOLOv8s with synthetic dataset addition

            <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><strong>YOLOv8s:</strong> 0.39 - YOLOv8s with reduced prediction confidence

            <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><strong>YOLOv8s:</strong> 0.43 - YOLOv8s training with pre-trained weights
              and AdamW optimizer</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><strong>YOLOv8s:</strong> 0.45 - Resuming training from previous best model
              (YOLOv8s score 0.48) with AdamW optimizer</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><strong>YOLOv8s:</strong> 0.46 - Similar to the previous experiment with
              adjusted prediction threshold configurations</li>
          </ul>
          <p>From these experiments, we can conclude that our submission scores are mainly contributed by the quality of
            the dataset. We managed to achieve the highest score of 0.48 solely from the dataset itself. Our focus was
            primarily on preparing the training dataset, with minimal time allocated to model development. Given more
            time, we would explore various training configurations, model backbones, and architectures. Additionally, we
            would enhance our synthetic image generation models and collect more diverse datasets to further improve our
            results.</p>

            <strong>1. Dataset is all you need:</strong> It is evident that everything comes down to how we prepare the
            dataset for training a machine learning model. No matter how deep the neural networks are or how
            sophisticated the model is, if the dataset is of poor quality, our model will never be able to make accurate
            predictions. Our experiments have shown that with a quality dataset, achieving a minimum of 0.40 is
            possible, which is sufficient to meet the minimum requirement by EY for a certificate of completion. Our
            team spent most of the time annotating the dataset and preparing a high-quality dataset. Each label was
            cross-referenced with reliable sources using Google Maps, OpenStreetMap, and even Google 3D street view to
            determine the class for each building.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>2. Start with a small model:</strong> It is advisable to begin with a small model when embarking on
            a machine learning project. When selecting a model for training, starting with the smallest and lightest
            model is preferable before moving on to larger and heavier models. The complexity of a model depends on its
            parameters and the depth of its layers. By starting with a small model, we have more flexibility to expand
            further with larger models. Our best model is the small variant of YOLOv8, and although we attempted to
            train YOLOv8m and YOLOv8l, we were unable to surpass our small model. Please note that these findings are
            based on our experiments, and other teams may obtain different results.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>3. Not everything goes your way:</strong> Despite our efforts to address the imbalanced dataset by
            generating synthetic data with Stable Diffusion 2, the results did not meet our expectations. We anticipated
            that resolving the imbalance would lead to improved model performance, but this was not the case. Several
            factors may have contributed to this outcome, including insufficient training of the stable diffusion model
            to generate synthetic data resembling the actual dataset, lack of generalization in the model, and limited
            variation in the synthetic dataset. It is important to remember that machine learning involves
            experimentation. By continually experimenting with different settings, architectures, and approaches, we may
            eventually build a better model through trial, error, and continuous testing and monitoring.
